# Trump Truth Social → Telegram Bot

Fetches Donald Trump's latest posts from Truth Social, translates them to
Hebrew, and broadcasts them to every subscriber. Runs on GitHub Actions
every 10 minutes, uses the Python standard library only.

The bot is **broadcast-only**:
- Anyone can `/start` the bot in a private chat to subscribe.
- Anyone can add the bot to a group or channel to broadcast there.
- No slash-command menu is shown. All other messages are ignored silently —
  users can't trigger any action.

## Setup

1. **Create a Telegram bot** with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and
   copy the bot token.
2. **Add repository secrets** under *Settings → Secrets and variables →
   Actions*:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — required.
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — optional. If set, this chat is seeded as the
     initial subscriber so you start receiving posts before anyone else
     subscribes.
3. **Enable GitHub Actions** for the repository. The workflow will run
   automatically every 10 minutes; you can also trigger it manually from
   *Actions → Trump Truth Social Check → Run workflow*.
4. **Subscribe** — open a chat with the bot and send `/start`, or add the
   bot to a group / channel (as admin, for channels).

## Layout

```
.github/workflows/trump-check.yml   GitHub Actions cron workflow
src/main.py                         Pipeline: fetch → translate → broadcast
data/last_seen.txt                  Last processed post id (auto-updated)
data/last_update_id.txt             Last processed Telegram update id
data/subscribers.txt                Chat IDs receiving the broadcast
BOT-CONTROLS.sh                     gh-cli helper (status / run / logs)
```

## Configuration

- **Schedule** — edit the `cron` expression in `trump-check.yml`.
- **Message format** — edit `build_message()` in `src/main.py`.
- **Welcome text** — edit `send_welcome()` in `src/main.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (uses `zoneinfo` from stdlib)
- A Telegram bot token and target chat id
- GitHub Actions enabled on the repository
